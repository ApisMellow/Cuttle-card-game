// Win timing ruling: a player can reach their win threshold during the
// opponent's turn (the opponent pops their own Jack with a 2, or plays a 6,
// and a point card returns to the player). There is no off-turn win. The
// player wins at the start of their next turn, as soon as the turn passes to
// them and before they must make any move.
//
// A counter window is not a turn. The player answering a counter is Active,
// but their turn has not begun; it begins only once the chain resolves and
